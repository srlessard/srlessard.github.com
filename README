In this assignment, I created three personal web pages to create a brief portfolio about myself. 
I included a home page (index.html), a biography (bio.html), and a resume (resume.html). These three webpages
were written in html5 along with two css pages for inheritance-based style.

I believe all aspects of the assignment have been completed succesfully.
This assignment took me about 2 hours to complete.
